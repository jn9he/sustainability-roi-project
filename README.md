# Project Background

Large synthetic dataset was generated to mimic a university’s campus-wide energy use, costs, and sustainability program metrics. Ensured data inconsistencies and realistic messiness in order to mirror real-world operational data.

# Project Summary
 
The dataset used in this project is synthetic, generated to preserve realistic patterns, trends, and inconsistencies. The data set contains 50,000+ total records, which is appropriate for meaningful analysis.

In this project, I analyzed a dataset to investigate trends and growth rates in energy consumption, cost savings, waste reduction, renewable energy adoption, and water usage efficiency. Additionally, I  examined a recently launched campus sustainability incentive program to assess its impact on overall utility costs, student participation, and environmental outcomes.

This project consists of four parts:

- **Part 1: Trends**
-  Using Excel, I take a high-level look at broad operational and environmental trends within the data to identify notable insights for the facilities, finance, and sustainability teams.

- Part 2: **Targeted Insights**
-  With the aid of SQL, I extract targeted insights for university decision-makers, such as the performance of solar panel installations, recycling participation rates, and cost-effectiveness of green infrastructure projects.

- Part 3: **Visualizations**
-  Leveraging Tableau, I create an interactive dashboard for facilities, finance, and sustainability teams (as well as campus leadership) to monitor key performance indicators on an ongoing basis.

- Part 4: **Recommendations & Next Steps**
-  Actionable suggestions for future sustainability initiatives, funding allocations, and operational improvements to enhance ROI and environmental impact.

The dataset spans multiple tables containing information on campus facilities, utility usage, sustainability programs, and geographic site details.

### Overview of Findings

[](https://github.com/AnalyticsAccelerator/sample_repo#overview-of-findings)

Explain the overarching findings, trends, and themes in 2-3 sentences here. This section should address the question: "If a stakeholder were to take away 3 main insights from your project, what are the most important things they should know?" You can put yourself in the shoes of a specific stakeholder - for example, a marketing manager or finance director - to think creatively about this section.

# Assumptions and Caveats:

[](https://github.com/AnalyticsAccelerator/sample_repo#assumptions-and-caveats)

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

- Assumption 1 (ex: missing country records were for customers based in the US, and were re-coded to be US citizens)
    
- Assumption 1 (ex: data for December 2021 was missing - this was imputed using a combination of historical trends and December 2020 data)
    
- Assumption 1 (ex: because 3% of the refund date column contained non-sensical dates, these were excluded from the analysis)
